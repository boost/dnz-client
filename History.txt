=== 0.1.3 2010-05-26

* Fix for filtering bug where filters would combine incorrectly with search terms. For example:

  :search_text => 'id:123 OR id:321', :filter => {:content_partner => 'National Library'}

before this fix this would result in the following search being run:

  id:123 OR id:321 AND content_partner:"National Library"

clearly this does not follow the intent of the filter option, as it would only return id:321 if it is from
the National Library partner, but would return id:123 regardless.

After the change:

  (id:123 OR id:321) AND content_partner:"National Library"
